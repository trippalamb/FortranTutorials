# Introduction

After nearly ten years of development in Fortran, I've determined there is no solid comprehensive set of Fortran tutorials (honestly I'm not even sure there is a solid set and definitely not comprehensive). I believe at it's core Fortran is an underrated and beautiful language that naturally lends itself towards good organization if used properly. That being said there are definitely some issues and some features it lacks. It also lacks a healthy online community, package manager, and (as mentioned before) good tutorial set.

That is where this comes in. Who knows if I'll succeed, but the goal is to create a good set of tutorials that focuses on modern Fortran, and while I may mention some archaic syntax, I will note when I think there are better options. We will cover all of the newer functionality while attempting to keep things as minimal as possible. I might throw in some attempts at humor. I apologize in advance.
